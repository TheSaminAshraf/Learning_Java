// Java Review: Putting It All Together

// Java programs have at least one class and one main() method/function.
// Each class represents one real-world idea and the main() method runs the tasks of the program.
// Java comments add helpful context to human readers.
// Java has whitespace, curly braces and semicolons.
// Whitespace is for humans to read easily, curly braces mark the scope of a class and method,
// and semicolons mark the end of a statement.
// Java is a compiled language.
// Compiling catches mistakes in our code and compilers transform code into an executable class.
