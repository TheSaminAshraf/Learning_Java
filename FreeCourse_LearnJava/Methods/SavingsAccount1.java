// Review

// Methods are a powerful way to abstract tasks away and make them repeatable.
// They allow us to define behavior for classes, so that the Objects we create can do the things we expect them to.
// Defining a method : Method declarations will declare a methodâ€™s return type, name, and parameters.
// Calling a method : Methods are invoked with a . and ().
// Parameters : Inputs to the method and their types are declared in parentheses in the method signature.
// Changing Instance Fields : Methods can be used to change the value of an instance field.
// Scope : Variables only exist within the domain that they are created in.
// Return: The type of the variables that will be output are declared in the method declaration.
