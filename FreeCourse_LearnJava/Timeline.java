// Commenting Code

// When comments are short we use the single-line syntax.
// When comments are long, we use the multi-line syntax /* */.
// Another type of commenting option is the Javadoc comment which is represented by /** and */.
// Javadoc comments are used to create documentation for APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).
// These are typically written before the declaration of fields, methods and classes.
