// ints

// In Java, whole numbers are stored in the int primitive data type.
// ints hold positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero.
// They do not store fractions or numbers with decimals in them.
// The int data type allows values between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647, inclusive.
// To declare a variable of type int, we use the int keyword before the variable name.
