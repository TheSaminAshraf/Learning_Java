// Static Checking

// Java has static typing (unlike Python which has dynamic typing).
// Java programs will not compile if a variable is assigned a value of an incorrect type.
// This is a bug, specifically a type declaration bug.
// When bugs are not caught at compilation, they interrupt execution of the code by causing runtime errors. 
// The program will crash.
// Javaâ€™s static typing helps programmers avoid runtime errors, and thus have much safer code that is free from bugs.
